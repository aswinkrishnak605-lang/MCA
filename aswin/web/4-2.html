      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Onam is the most iconic and widely celebrated festival in the Indian state of Kerala. It is a harvest festival that typically falls in the month of Chingam (August–September) according to the Malayalam calendar, and marks the homecoming of the legendary King Mahabali. Onam is not just a religious festival but a cultural extravaganza that transcends caste, creed, and religion, bringing together all Keralites in joyful celebration.

      <h2>Mythological Significance</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of Onam lies the legend of King Mahabali, a benevolent and just ruler from ancient times. According to Hindu mythology, Mahabali was an Asura (demon) king who ruled over Kerala and brought immense prosperity and happiness to his people. His reign was considered the golden era of Kerala, where there was no discrimination, crime, or poverty.

However, the gods grew jealous of his popularity and power. To curb his influence, Lord Vishnu took his fifth avatar as Vamana, a dwarf Brahmin. Vamana approached Mahabali and asked for three paces of land. Mahabali agreed, and Vamana then grew to a gigantic size, covering the earth and sky with two steps. For the third step, Mahabali offered his own head, and he was pushed down to the netherworld (Patala). However, due to his humility and devotion, Vishnu granted him a boon to visit his people once every year. Onam marks this annual visit of King Mahabali to his beloved land.

        One of the most iconic symbols of Onam, Pookkalam is a beautiful arrangement of flowers laid out in intricate patterns at the entrance of homes. Each day a new layer of flowers is added, symbolizing prosperity and joy.
        The Onasadya is a grand vegetarian feast served on a banana leaf and typically includes 26 or more dishes. Must-haves include rice, sambar, avial, thoran, olan, erissery, pachadi, pickle, banana chips, papadam, and payasam (a sweet dessert).
