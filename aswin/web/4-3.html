      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Holi is one of the most joyful and exuberant festivals celebrated in India and by Hindus around the world. Known as the "Festival of Colors", Holi marks the arrival of spring, the victory of good over evil, and a time for people to forgive, forget, and unite. The festival is characterized by throwing colored powders, singing, dancing, and spreading love and happiness.

It is typically celebrated in the month of Phalguna (Februaryâ€“March), according to the Hindu calendar, and spans over two days â€” Holika Dahan (bonfire night) and Rangwali Holi (color day).

      <h2>Mythological Significance</h2>
      <p>
        Holi has deep roots in Hindu mythology and is associated with several legends:

ðŸ”¥ The Legend of Prahlad and Holika

The most prominent story is of Prahlad, a devout follower of Lord Vishnu, and his evil father King Hiranyakashipu, who wanted everyone to worship him. But Prahlad refused to obey and continued worshipping Vishnu. Hiranyakashipuâ€™s sister, Holika, had a magical cloak that made her immune to fire. She sat on a pyre with Prahlad in her lap, intending to kill him. However, due to his devotion and the protection of Vishnu, Holika was burned to ashes, while Prahlad emerged unharmed. This symbolizes the victory of good over evil and is commemorated with Holika Dahan, a ritual bonfire held on the eve of Holi.

      <h2>Cultural Traditions</h2>
      <p>
        Holi is more than just a fun festival â€” it is a cultural celebration that promotes unity, equality, and joy. It marks the end of winter and the beginning of the spring harvest, making it a time of abundance and renewal. Traditionally, it was a way for communities to come together and celebrate the fertility of the land and the joy of nature.

      <p>
        On the night before Holi, people gather to perform Holika Dahan â€” lighting bonfires to symbolize the burning of evil. Communities come together, perform rituals, sing devotional songs, and circle the fire in prayer.
        The next day is the main celebration, where people of all ages take to the streets to throw colors, spray colored water, dance to music, and enjoy festive foods. It is a time when social norms are relaxed â€” everyone is fair game for color, whether friend or stranger, young or old, rich or poor.

      <h2>A Festival of Unity and Forgiveness</h2>
      <p>
        Holi serves as a social equalizer. Differences of caste, creed, gender, and age dissolve in a splash of color. It is a time to let go of grudges, repair broken relationships, and start afresh.Holi has become increasingly global, celebrated in many countries with Indian communities, including Nepal, the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, South Africa, and more. Events like the "Festival of Colors" attract people of all backgrounds to celebrate Indian culture and the joy of human connection.
